# gbEplus
gbEplus is an open source gbXML to EnergyPlus convertor written in JAVA.
The tool was firstly inspired by the [OpenStudio](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio) gbXML module. The initial version was developed by [Weili Xu](https://github.com/weilixu) to facilitates the creation of simple IDF geometries from revit. Quickly, after realizing the simple geometry conversion is merely enough for a successful energy simulation, Weili and [Haopeng Wang](https://github.com/wanghp18) from CMU IW started working on the second version development in their spare time in CMU.
